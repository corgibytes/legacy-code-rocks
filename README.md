# Legacy Code Rocks!

##About

At the Agile2015 conference, a funny thing happened. A bunch of us were there who loved fixing broken code. We were so eager to find each other that we decided to stay in touch through a Slack group. Since then, our community has grown. We have weekly mastermind calls, a newsletter that goes out every month or so, a podcast, and there's even talk of a conference. If you enjoy fixing sofware as much (or more) as you enjoy building it, you belong here. Welcome!
